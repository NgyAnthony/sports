    description: 'Cricket is a team sport of ball and bat played by two teams normally consisting of eleven players each. It is usually played on an oval-shaped grass pitch, in the centre of which is an area about twenty metres long, at each end of which there is a wooden structure, the wicket. A match is divided into several rounds. During each round, one of the teams tries to score points (runs), and simultaneously has two beaters on the field, each in front of one of the wickets. In particular, a point is scored each time these two players exchange positions when the ball is in play. Their eleven opponents are also present on the field of play. The ball is thrown by one of them towards the wicket of one of the two beaters. The aim of the second team is to prevent the first team from scoring, mainly by eliminating the opposing batsmen, for example by destroying the wicket with the ball on the pitch.',
